# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel about your use of built-in Ruby methods?\
*I feel pretty good about my use of built-in methods. I am comfortable using Ruby-Docs to look up available methods for each data type and following the examples given to try these out in practice. Some of the return values, and optional arguments, confuse me a bit and I'm less comfortable knowing them or employing them, but feel good about being able to look these up and use trial and error and IRB to test them out and see the results.*

- How confident do you feel writing simple methods of your own?\
*I'd say I'm about an 8 out of 10 on writing simple methods on my own. I feel good about the examples given in this lesson and generally get how to work with some simple parameters, store return values, and write the inside of a defined method to do what I want it to do with code. My least confident area is identifying return values, I do need to check output in my terminal and refer back to the lesson materials to confidently answer those types of questions.*

- What questions do you have about methods, and what they are capable of? (ask a question!!!)\
*One question I have when working with self-defined methods is how you KNOW what data type to provide as an arguement when calling a method that you've written to include one or more parameters. The syntax doesn't seem to give any indication that the data type should be say, a String versus an Integer. Do you rely on code notes? Or error messages? Is there a standard way to make this clear, or something else?*
